# Exercises

## Overview

This project contains a series of exercises on algorithms and data structures. Each exercise is designed to help me muscle my problem-solving skills and deepen my Python skills for AI and machine learning.

### First Exercise: Magical number - Amstrong number
An Armstrong number (or narcissistic number) is a number that is equal to the sum of its own digits each raised to the power of the number of digits. For example, 153 is an Armstrong number because:
1^3 + 5^3 + 3^3 = 153

### Second Exercise: Custom Sorting Algorithm
Implementing a custom sorting algorithm to sort a list of word first based on their lengths and then alphabetically for words of the same length.

### Third Exercise: RLE Compression
Implementing a Run-Length Encoding (RLE) compression algorithm that compresses a string by replacing consecutive identical characters with the character followed by the count of repetitions.
